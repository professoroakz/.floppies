## ⚙️ Configuration

### Dotfiles
The installer creates/updates these configuration files:
- `.bashrc` / `.bash_profile`
- `.zshrc` (with Oh My Zsh)
- `.vimrc`
- `.tmux.conf`
- `.gitconfig`
- VSCode `settings.json`

### Backups
Before modifying any existing dotfiles, .floppies creates a backup at:
```
~/.dotfiles_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
```

### Shell Configuration
The installed shell configs include:
- Modern command aliases
- Git shortcuts
- PATH configuration for all installed tools
- Language version managers (nvm, pyenv, rbenv)
- Color support
- History configuration

## 🔧 Post-Installation

After installation:

1. **Restart your terminal** or run:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. **Docker users**: Log out and back in for group changes to take effect

3. **Configure Git** (if not already configured):
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

4. **Install Vim plugins** (optional):
   ```bash
   vim +PlugInstall +qall
   ```

5. **Install tmux plugins** (optional):
   Press `Ctrl+a` then `I` in tmux

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Homebrew on Apple Silicon
If Homebrew commands aren't found after installation:
```bash
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

### Permission issues
If you get permission errors, don't run the installer as root/sudo. It will prompt for sudo when needed.

### Missing packages
If a package fails to install, you can:
1. Run the installer again (it skips already installed packages)
2. Install manually using your package manager
3. Check the logs for specific errors

### VSCode extensions fail to install
If you're on WSL/remote systems, install VSCode on the host machine first.

## 🔄 Updating

To update .floppies and your installed tools:

```bash
cd .floppies
git pull
./install.sh
# Select option 4: Update Existing Installation
```

## 🗑️ Uninstalling

Run the installer and select option 5 (Uninstall), or:

```bash
./install.sh
# Select option 5: Uninstall
```

You'll be asked if you want to:
- Remove installed packages

## Description

Analyzed 65+ repositories to create a one-command setup that installs and configures development tools across macOS, Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/RHEL/Arch), Windows (WSL/Git Bash), and Unix.

> Analyze all my repos and how I code and what tools I've been using, will need, have needed. This is .floppies which should install EVERYTHING I need for terminal, vscode situation, it's supposed to be the first thing I execute and only thing I need to clone+execute on any machine, macos windows ubuntu linux blabla unix. Primarily for computers, not for iOS or Android. But that would be awesome too, if you can include similar.
